- 👋 Hi, I’m @Frothy-Hax. I'm based in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧. I'm an IT Infrastructure Technician 🖥️ Looking to develop my skills in Cyber Security 🔐
- 👀 I’m interested in Cyber Security and Systems Administration (Windows & Linux platforms, on-prem, hybrid and cloud environments), particularly automation in those areas! 🤖
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ropes with Kali Linux. I've spent plenty of time doing virtual labs on TryHackMe and HackTheBox and have a decent understanding of basic pen-testing tools! ⚔️
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on; Nothing at the moment, i'm just here to learn and mainly use GitHub to upload some (probably poorly written) scripts that i'll be creating ⌨️
- 📫 How to reach me; Right now, i've not got any contact info! I will be setting up a personal website in the near future however 📪 📵
